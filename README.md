### I'm going to try to answer these questions to the best of my abilities. Ask me if something is confusing. 
Design Ideas:
  * There will be a need to do some A/B testing. The good thing is that we can narrow the A/B testing to 2 different ideas: 
    * (Recommended) One screen at time, where the user will look at a screen and if they have multiple screens then the side of the screens will be visible for them to see, and when they look one side it will trigger the view to be of the other screen.  **Complex Part** We will need to be precise with the user looking at one view to another based on the movement of their head
    * Players will be able to manipulate all the screens into their view and pull one closer to the view of their interest. So it looks like the link you sent me where they can look at all the screens at the same time, then in their AR view they can bring one screen closer to them than the others. **Complex Part** Won't be as difficult. However I believe it'll be tough to move the screens to their liking, maybe with their hands or mouse.
  
* We have to get the notifications show up on outside of all the browsers, if they have slack way in the back and not looking, it's important that no matter what view they're looking at they'll get a notification of a message sent.
